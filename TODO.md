I would have liked to add different language support - 
How we can do that - We can add a dropdown on header and make an graphql call with that particular language variable.

I would have liked to add some more test cases but was facing some issue as Apollo client was throwing Error.
But Still I have added test cases for Sidebar and User.reducer.ts showing the approach I wil take for testing component and normal typescript file.

CSS and media query I would have liked to improve on.
Sidebar can be hidden in less than 600px (mobile screens) and a button can be added on top which can enable us to show sidebar as overlay the sidebar that button was clicked.
